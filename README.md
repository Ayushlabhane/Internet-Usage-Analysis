## 🌐 Internet Usage Analysis by Age Group

### 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing daily internet usage patterns across different age groups to understand how digital consumption varies with age.
The analysis follows a complete data analytics workflow — starting from raw Excel data, performing structured analysis using SQL, and finally visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The goal of this project is to convert raw usage data into clear, interpretable insights that can help in understanding digital behavior trends across demographics.

### 🎯 Purpose of the Analysis
The primary purpose of this analysis is to:
- Understand how internet usage differs across age groups
- Identify which age segments spend more time online daily
- Analyze trends and variations in usage duration
- Present insights in a clear, visual format for easy interpretation

### 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed
- Average daily internet usage (in hours)
- Internet usage distribution by age group
- Comparison of high vs low usage age segments
- Overall usage trends across demographics

### 🗂 Dataset Information
The dataset was originally provided in Excel format and contains information related to:
- Age groups
- Daily internet usage duration
- Aggregated usage values
- After cleaning and standardizing the data, it was converted into a CSV file for structured analysis using SQL.

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Excel – Initial data inspection, cleaning, and formatting
- CSV – Structured data storage
- SQL – Data querying and insight extraction
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visual analysis
- GitHub – Version control and documentation

### 🔎 Business Questions Answered
1. What is the average time spent on work/study, social media, and entertainment by users aged between 15 and 30?
2. How many mobile users have a total screen time exceeding 10 hours per day?
3. Which are the top 5 months with the highest number of users spending more than 5 hours on work/study?
4. What is the average work/study time of users who primarily use laptops and spend more than 5 hours on work/study?
5. How does total time spent on social media, work/study, and entertainment vary across different age groups?
6. Which internet connection type accounts for the highest overall usage hours across activities?
7. Which age group has the highest total screen time?
8. Which primary device contributes to the highest total screen time?
9. How does screen time split between productivity and leisure vary by device type?
10. Which device and internet type combination shows the highest productivity ratio (work/study vs leisure)?
11. Which age groups exceed healthy screen time limits most frequently?

### 📈 Dashboard Summary
The Power BI dashboard provides a visual representation of:
- Internet usage comparison across age groups
- Clear identification of high-usage and low-usage segments
- Simple, readable charts focused on demographic insights
- The dashboard is designed to be intuitive, allowing viewers to quickly grasp usage patterns without needing technical background.

3 Data Transformation
- Converted cleaned data into CSV format
 4. SQL Analysis
- Executed SQL queries to calculate usage metrics and comparisons
5. Visualization
- Connected SQL output to Power BI
- Built an interactive dashboard to present insights

### 📌 Key Takeaways
- Internet usage varies significantly across age groups
- Certain age ranges consistently show higher daily usage
- Visual analysis makes demographic trends easier to interpret than raw tables

### ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to work with demographic datasets and apply SQL-based analysis to uncover meaningful usage patterns.
It highlights practical skills in data preparation, querying, and visualization, following a real-world analytics workflow.
